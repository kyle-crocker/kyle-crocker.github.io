A simple example of this phenomenon manifests in stepwise metabolic processes, wherein energy is incrementally harvested from a cascade of chemical conversions (e.g., denitrification). Often in these processes, we observe that metabolic labor can either be divided among species that perform individual steps, or monopolized by species that perform all steps, with the predominance of one strategy over another depending on the environmental context.\nMetabolic constraints that impose tradeoffs on an organism’s ability to perform multiple steps may underlie whether the division of labor is favorable in a particular environment. A major gap in our knowledge is how environmental context influences metabolic constraints to determine when the division of labor is favored.\nPostdoc Kyle Crocker and I are pursuing a statistical and experimental effort to learn how metabolic tradeoffs in bacterial denitrification are influenced by the chemical environment to determine when the division of metabolic labor is favored.\n","date":1633651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633651200,"objectID":"37fecec3f627ed65185e5cdce6ef8a3d","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/project/division_labor/","publishdate":"2021-10-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/division_labor/","section":"project","summary":"How do environmentally-imposed constraints shape division of metabolic labor in bacterial denitrification?","tags":null,"title":"How constraints shape division of metabolic labor","type":"project"},{"authors":["Karna Gowda","Derek Ping","Madhav Mani","Seppe Kuehn"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605273399,"objectID":"d06336a57baf75b724a64ec1882bc11e","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/publication/gowda-2020-09-29-315713/","publishdate":"2020-11-13T13:16:39.012026Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gowda-2020-09-29-315713/","section":"publication","summary":"The metabolic function of microbial communities emerges through a complex hierarchy of genome-encoded processes, from gene expression to interactions between diverse taxa. Therefore, a central challenge for microbial ecology is deciphering how genomic structure determines metabolic function in communities. Here we show, for the process of denitrification, that community metabolism is quantitatively predicted from the genes each member of the community possesses. For each strain in a set of bacterial isolates, the dynamics of nitrate and nitrite reduction are quantitatively encoded in the presence or absence of denitrification genes. We correctly predict metabolite dynamics in communities using a consumer-resource model that sums the contribution of each strain. Our results enable predicting metabolite dynamics from metagenomes, designing denitrifying communities and discovering how genome evolution impacts metabolism.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","tags":[],"title":"A sparse mapping of structure to function in microbial communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David T.

Understanding when and how generalists or specialists evolve is an important question in evolutionary dynamics. Here we study the evolution of bacterial range expansions by selecting Escherichia coli for faster migration through porous media containing one of four different sugars supporting growth and chemotaxis. We find that selection in any one sugar drives the evolution of faster migration in all sugars. Measurements of growth and motility of all evolved lineages in all nutrient conditions reveal that the ubiquitous evolution of fast migration arises via phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity permits evolved strains to exploit distinct strategies to achieve fast migration in each environment, irrespective of the environment in which they were evolved. Therefore, selection in a homogenous environment drives phenotypic plasticity that improves performance in other environments.","tags":[],"title":"Evolution of generalists by phenotypic plasticity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The structure, or \u0026ldquo;parts list,\u0026rdquo; of microbial communities is determined by numerous diverse populations, each responding to different environmental cues, interacting with other populations, and shaping the chemical surroundings. Because of all these variables, it would appear that the relationship between community structure and collective metabolic function is hopelessly complex. But what if only a small amount of the community \u0026ldquo;parts list\u0026rdquo; were relevant to collective metabolic activity? Discovering what principles govern the mapping from the genomic structure to the metabolic activity of microbial communities would give us great insight into how communities organize, operate, and evolve.\nIn this project, we demonstrated that the metabolite dynamics of a microbial community can be predicted from a small number of genes each member of the community possesses. To do this, we developed an experimental and statistical approach that leveraged natural variation over a collection of diverse bacterial strains to map genotypes to community-level metabolic phenotypes. This work illustrated that key metabolic genes can be used to predict community-level behavior, which opens the door to predicting metabolic fluxes in natural environments from metagenomic sequencing, designing denitrifying bacterial communities for use in wastewater treatment, and discovering how genome evolution impacts metabolic phenotypes.\nRelated manuscript:\nA sparse mapping of structure to function in microbial communities\nKarna Gowda, Derek Ping, Madhav Mani, Seppe Kuehn\nbioRxiv 2020.09.29.315713; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.29.315713\n","date":1601424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601424000,"objectID":"24cb546ba641a204aaef66139c564392","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/project/structure_function/","publishdate":"2020-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/structure_function/","section":"project","summary":"What principles govern the mapping from the genomic structure to the metabolic activity of microbial communities?","tags":null,"title":"Mapping structure and function in microbial communities","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1589209852,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589209852,"objectID":"06b5b870eb7ce3de5421543c9928c44f","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/post/aps-2020-talk/","publishdate":"2020-05-11T10:10:52-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/aps-2020-talk/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"APS 2020 online talk","type":"post"},{"authors":["Karna Gowda","Sarah Iams","Mary Silber"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605273399,"objectID":"e91535a77c701b9a1d4de4c1bdc332ab","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/publication/gowda-signatures-2018/","publishdate":"2020-11-13T13:16:39.308876Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gowda-signatures-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Signatures of human impact on self-organized vegetation in the Horn of Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Punit Gandhi","Lucien Werner","Sarah Iams","Karna Gowda","Mary Silber"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605273399,"objectID":"89d1770d92a8990c24530762504c5cd3","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/publication/gandhi-topographic-2018/","publishdate":"2020-11-13T13:16:39.16302Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gandhi-topographic-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A topographic mechanism for arcing of dryland vegetation bands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karna Gowda","Yuxin Chen","Sarah Iams","Mary Silber"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1456790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605273399,"objectID":"bfebb5fe6ab07c6f25ff096edbf800a8","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/publication/gowda-assessing-2016/","publishdate":"2020-11-13T13:16:39.381893Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gowda-assessing-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Assessing the robustness of spatial pattern sequences in a dryland vegetation model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karna Gowda","Christian Kuehn"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1430438400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605273399,"objectID":"a7c29a3593aae69a3a5b726721aff983","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/publication/gowda-early-warning-2015/","publishdate":"2020-11-13T13:16:39.235657Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gowda-early-warning-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"There have been signiﬁcant recent advances in our understanding of the potential use and limitations of early-warning signs for predicting drastic changes, so called critical transitions or tipping points, in dynamical systems. A focus of mathematical modeling and analysis has been on stochastic ordinary differential equations, where generic statistical earlywarning signs can be identiﬁed near bifurcation-induced tipping points. In this paper, we outline some basic steps to extend this theory to stochastic partial differential equations with a focus on analytically characterizing basic scaling laws for linear SPDEs and comparing the results to numerical simulations of fully nonlinear problems. In particular, we study stochastic versions of the Swift–Hohenberg and Ginzburg–Landau equations. We derive a scaling law of the covariance operator in a regime where linearization is expected to be a good approximation for the local ﬂuctuations around deterministic steady states. We compare these results to direct numerical simulation, and study the inﬂuence of noise level, noise color, distance to bifurcation and domain size on early-warning signs.","tags":[],"title":"Early-warning signs for pattern-formation in stochastic partial differential equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karna Gowda","Hermann Riecke","Mary Silber"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1391212800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605273399,"objectID":"91cb983b5bdd6e07c6bb299ffea03398","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/publication/gowda-transitions-2014/","publishdate":"2020-11-13T13:16:39.454756Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gowda-transitions-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Transitions between patterned states in vegetation models for semiarid ecosystems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Simon Freedman, Madhav Mani, and I are excited to announce a virtual seminar series entitled Theory of Biological Systems.
