abstract = {The metabolic activity of microbial communities plays a primary role in the flow of essential nutrients throughout the biosphere. Molecular genetics has revealed the metabolic pathways that model organisms utilize to generate energy and biomass, but we understand little about how the metabolism of diverse, natural communities emerges from the collective action of its constituents. We propose that quantifying and mapping metabolic fluxes to sequencing measurements of genomic, taxonomic or transcriptional variation across an ensemble of diverse communities, either in the laboratory or the wild, can reveal low-dimensional descriptions of community structure that can explain or predict their emergent metabolic activity. We survey the types of communities for which this approach might be best suited, review the analytical techniques available for quantifying metabolite fluxes in communities, and discuss what types of data analysis approaches might be lucrative for learning the structure-function mapping in communities from these data.}

	abstract = "Summary
	Adapting organisms face a tension between specializing their phenotypes for certain ecological tasks and developing generalist strategies that permit persistence in multiple environmental conditions. Understanding when and how generalists or specialists evolve is an important question in evolutionary dynamics. Here we study the evolution of bacterial range expansions by selecting Escherichia coli for faster migration through porous media containing one of four different sugars supporting growth and chemotaxis. We find that selection in any one sugar drives the evolution of faster migration in all sugars. Measurements of growth and motility of all evolved lineages in all nutrient conditions reveal that the ubiquitous evolution of fast migration arises via phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity permits evolved strains to exploit distinct strategies to achieve fast migration in each environment, irrespective of the environment in which they were evolved. Therefore, selection in a homogenous environment drives phenotypic plasticity that improves performance in other environments."

	abstract = {There have been signiﬁcant recent advances in our understanding of the potential use and limitations of early-warning signs for predicting drastic changes, so called critical transitions or tipping points, in dynamical systems. A focus of mathematical modeling and analysis has been on stochastic ordinary differential equations, where generic statistical earlywarning signs can be identiﬁed near bifurcation-induced tipping points. In this paper, we outline some basic steps to extend this theory to stochastic partial differential equations with a focus on analytically characterizing basic scaling laws for linear SPDEs and comparing the results to numerical simulations of fully nonlinear problems. In particular, we study stochastic versions of the Swift–Hohenberg and Ginzburg–Landau equations. We derive a scaling law of the covariance operator in a regime where linearization is expected to be a good approximation for the local ﬂuctuations around deterministic steady states. We compare these results to direct numerical simulation, and study the inﬂuence of noise level, noise color, distance to bifurcation and domain size on early-warning signs.},
