An essential property of microbial communities is that they distribute the burden of metabolic “labor” (i.e., the harvesting of available energy in an environment) over many species that take on distinct roles. A simple example of this phenomenon manifests in stepwise metabolic processes, wherein energy is incrementally harvested from a cascade of chemical conversions (e.g., denitrification). Often in these processes, we observe that metabolic labor can either be divided among species that perform individual steps, or monopolized by species that perform all steps, with the predominance of one strategy over another depending on the environmental context. 

Metabolic constraints that impose tradeoffs on an organism’s ability to perform multiple steps may underlie whether the division of labor is favorable in a particular environment. A major gap in our knowledge is how environmental context influences metabolic constraints to determine when the division of labor is favored. 

Postdoc Kyle Crocker and I are pursuing a statistical and experimental effort to learn how metabolic tradeoffs in bacterial denitrification are influenced by the chemical environment to determine when the division of metabolic labor is favored.
