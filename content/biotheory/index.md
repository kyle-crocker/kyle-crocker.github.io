[Simon Freedman](https://simfreed.github.io/), [Madhav Mani](https://www.madhavmani.com/), and I are excited to announce a virtual seminar series entitled Theory of Biological Systems. Our goal in this series is to provide a platform for students and early career scientists to become educated on the latest research topics on the interface of biology, physics, and mathematics, and also to form cohesion between the disparate topics that our community studies.

Talks will take place every other Friday at 12:30pm -- 2:00pm Central Time (unless otherwise indicated), beginning in early November and continuing into the spring of 2022. Below is our exciting lineup of speakers for the coming months:

* Apr. 29th - [Marianne Bauer](https://biophysics.princeton.edu/people/marianne-bauer-0), Princeton University

In addition to showcasing cutting edge research, part of the emphasis of our series is to foster a conversation between speakers and the audience about topics of broad concern in the “Theory in Biology” community (e.g., where theorists could have the greatest impact, what are the big unsolved questions, and where may lay some research pitfalls).

We look forward to seeing you in our seminar series!
