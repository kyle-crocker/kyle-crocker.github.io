Microbial communities perform feats of metabolic chemistry that sustain life from microscopic to global scales. Though it is clear that an individual organismâ€™s metabolic capabilities control the conditions under which it can survive and thrive, we know little about how constraints imposed by physical and chemical limits on metabolism impact emergent community structure and behavior. 

My work is about discovering the metabolic constraints underlying the structure and activity of microbial communities. To do this, I am developing a new approach that leverages natural variation across microbial communities to discover the metabolic constraints underlying their structure and activity, which will enable me to develop empirically-driven theories about how constraints shape communities.

<!-- Microbial communities perform feats of metabolic chemistry that sustain life from microscopic to global scales. How do the parts of a community (e.g., the organisms that make up the community, along with their genes and metabolic capabilities) combine to make up the whole?

In my work, I bring wild bacterial communities from natural environments into the laboratory, and perform high-throughput quantitative measurements to characterize their community metabolic behavior. I then use these experiments to identify statistical regularities that tell us about how communities operate in nature. A big part of this "statistical ensembles" approach is developing and refining statistical tools and mathematical models that identify the low-dimensional structure in high dimensional data.  -->

<!--Life is biochemistry, and microbes are nature's premier biochemists, impacting all life from microscopic to global scales. A revolution in sequencing and computation has enabled us to observe the *who* (taxonomy) and the *what* (functional genomics) of natural microbial communities as never before. A major task that remains is to turn this wealth of information into predictive insights about how communities organize and operate, quantitatively and dynamically.

In general terms, the questions I am asking are:
- Given sequence data from a community (*structure*), how do we predict the biochemical fluxes of important metabolites (*function*) in that community?
- How do we design communities with defined metabolic functions (i.e., specifying function from structure)?
- How does community genomic structure depend on the biotic and abiotic environment? -->

I am currently Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Department of Ecology & Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) and [Center for Physics of Evolving Systems](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/eminent-bioengineering-scholar-lead-uchicagos-center-physics-evolving-systems). I am jointly mentored by [Seppe Kuehn](https://www.kuehnlab.org/) and [Madhav Mani](https://www.madhavmani.com/). I was a [James S. McDonnell Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.jsmf.org/programs/cs/) from 2017-2020. Prior to that, I completed a PhD in Applied Mathematics with [Mary Silber](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~msilber/), where I worked on pattern formation and geospatial data analysis relating to dryland ecology.
