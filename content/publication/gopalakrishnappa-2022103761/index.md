abstract: The metabolic activity of microbial communities plays a primary role in
  the flow of essential nutrients throughout the biosphere. Molecular genetics has
  revealed the metabolic pathways that model organisms utilize to generate energy
  and biomass, but we understand little about how the metabolism of diverse, natural
  communities emerges from the collective action of its constituents. We propose that
  quantifying and mapping metabolic fluxes to sequencing measurements of genomic,
  taxonomic or transcriptional variation across an ensemble of diverse communities,
  either in the laboratory or the wild, can reveal low-dimensional descriptions of
  community structure that can explain or predict their emergent metabolic activity.
  We survey the types of communities for which this approach might be best suited,
  review the analytical techniques available for quantifying metabolite fluxes in
  communities, and discuss what types of data analysis approaches might be lucrative
  for learning the structure-function mapping in communities from these data.
