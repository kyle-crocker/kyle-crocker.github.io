abstract: Summary Adapting organisms face a tension between specializing their phenotypes
  for certain ecological tasks and developing generalist strategies that permit persistence
  in multiple environmental conditions. Understanding when and how generalists or
  specialists evolve is an important question in evolutionary dynamics. Here we study
  the evolution of bacterial range expansions by selecting Escherichia coli for faster
  migration through porous media containing one of four different sugars supporting
  growth and chemotaxis. We find that selection in any one sugar drives the evolution
  of faster migration in all sugars. Measurements of growth and motility of all evolved
  lineages in all nutrient conditions reveal that the ubiquitous evolution of fast
  migration arises via phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity permits evolved
  strains to exploit distinct strategies to achieve fast migration in each environment,
  irrespective of the environment in which they were evolved. Therefore, selection
  in a homogenous environment drives phenotypic plasticity that improves performance
  in other environments.
