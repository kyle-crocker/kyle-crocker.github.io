abstract: There have been signiﬁcant recent advances in our understanding of the potential
  use and limitations of early-warning signs for predicting drastic changes, so called
  critical transitions or tipping points, in dynamical systems. A focus of mathematical
  modeling and analysis has been on stochastic ordinary differential equations, where
  generic statistical earlywarning signs can be identiﬁed near bifurcation-induced
  tipping points. In this paper, we outline some basic steps to extend this theory
  to stochastic partial differential equations with a focus on analytically characterizing
  basic scaling laws for linear SPDEs and comparing the results to numerical simulations
  of fully nonlinear problems. In particular, we study stochastic versions of the
  Swift–Hohenberg and Ginzburg–Landau equations. We derive a scaling law of the covariance
  operator in a regime where linearization is expected to be a good approximation
  for the local ﬂuctuations around deterministic steady states. We compare these results
  to direct numerical simulation, and study the inﬂuence of noise level, noise color,
  distance to bifurcation and domain size on early-warning signs.
