 abstract = {There have been signiﬁcant recent advances in our understanding of the potential use and limitations of early-warning signs for predicting drastic changes, so called critical transitions or tipping points, in dynamical systems. A focus of mathematical modeling and analysis has been on stochastic ordinary differential equations, where generic statistical earlywarning signs can be identiﬁed near bifurcation-induced tipping points. In this paper, we outline some basic steps to extend this theory to stochastic partial differential equations with a focus on analytically characterizing basic scaling laws for linear SPDEs and comparing the results to numerical simulations of fully nonlinear problems. In particular, we study stochastic versions of the Swift–Hohenberg and Ginzburg–Landau equations. We derive a scaling law of the covariance operator in a regime where linearization is expected to be a good approximation for the local ﬂuctuations around deterministic steady states. We compare these results to direct numerical simulation, and study the inﬂuence of noise level, noise color, distance to bifurcation and domain size on early-warning signs.},
